# firststep
Reduce stress and negative thoughts by completing simple tasks! 
First Step helps you take the first step towards better mental health and wellbeing.

## Inspiration
As humans, it is impossible to always be in perfect shape, health, and condition. This includes our mental health and wellbeing. To tackle this problem, we created a website that encourages users to complete simple tasks that have been proven to improve mood, drive, and wellbeing. These tasks include journaling, meditating and reflecting.

## What it does
It is a web-based platform with three main functions:
1. Generates reflective reminders and actionable suggestions
2. Provides a platform for journalling gratefulness and aspirations
3. Delivers sounds and visuals for peaceful meditation

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript to build the entire platform. We also used the following libraries: 

- Wired-elements: https://github.com/rough-stuff/wired-elements
- Flaticons: https://www.flaticon.com/
- Button Hover: https://codepen.io/davidicus/pen/emgQKJ

## Challenges we ran into
Communication between the backend and frontend could've been better. Often times, the backend sent code to the frontend with very little details which caused some confusion. There were also some issues with the size of the MP4 file during the upload to GitHub.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have finished the entire website way ahead of schedule with very minimal errors and problems. We are also proud of the user interface. 

## What we learned
- Backend to frontend integration
- Github Pages
- VScode Live Share
- Software Architecture

## What's next for First Step
- Develop mobile version
- Deploy to web 
- Improve responsive design
